"""Batch-run a list of steering experiments, loading the tokenizer only ONCE.

Each experiment is a `SteerConfig` (see steer_config.py) -- the same knobs `example_steer`
exposes on the CLI, but as a typed object instead of an argument string. We load the
tokenizer a single time, then run every experiment through `example_steer.run_experiment`,
capturing everything it prints. Each run is written to:

    simons_experiments/experiment_time=HH:MM:SS.txt

with the exact equivalent `example_steer` command on the first line, so you always know
what produced a given file. An experiment that sets `trace_file` additionally writes its
full per-step JSON trace there (point it inside simons_experiments/ to keep things tidy).

Edit the EXPERIMENTS list below and run:

    python run_experiments.py
