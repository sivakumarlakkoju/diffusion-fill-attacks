# Diffusion Fill Attacks

Fill-attack experiments against Google's **DiffusionGemma-26B-A4B-it**, a discrete-diffusion MoE LLM. Fill attacks are interesting on DiffusionGemma as it gives access to the whole Canvas of tokens (so attacks can be anywhere on the canvas) rather than the first few tokens as in Autoregressive models

## Setup

Create an isolated virtual environment and install the pinned dependencies:

```bash
cd hackathon_SST/diffusion_fill_attacks
python -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt
.venv/bin/python load_model.py   # smoke test
```

## Loading the model

All scripts share one loader. Import it instead of calling `from_pretrained` directly:

```python
from load_model import load_model

model, processor = load_model()  # full BF16 (~52 GB) — needs an 80 GB A100/H100
```

`load_model()` returns `(model, processor)`. Key options: `dtype=...` (defaults to
`"auto"` → the checkpoint's native BF16), `device_map=...` (defaults to `"auto"`),
`model_id=...` to override the repo, `hf_token=...` (else falls back to the `HF_TOKEN`
env var; public model so it's optional).

> Quantization was removed: bitsandbytes can't touch this model's batched MoE expert
> tensors (the bulk of the 26B params), so 4-bit/8-bit stayed ~52 GB and just forced
> slow CPU offload. Run it in full BF16 on a big GPU instead.

Run the module directly for a smoke test:

```bash
python load_model.py
```

Requires a CUDA GPU with enough memory for the full BF16 model (~52 GB → an 80 GB
A100/H100) and a recent `transformers` (one that ships
`DiffusionGemmaForBlockDiffusion`).

## Sharing one GPU between several people

The model only fits **once** on an 80 GB A100, so don't have everyone call
`load_model()`. Instead load it once in [`server.py`](server.py) and have everyone
prompt it over HTTP via [`client.py`](client.py) / [`example_client.py`](example_client.py):

```bash
.venv/bin/python server.py          # on the GPU box: loads once, then serves
python example_client.py --host a100-box   # from anywhere: no torch needed
```

See [SERVER.md](SERVER.md) for the full guide (API, remote access, concurrency).

## Steering / intervening in the denoising loop

The [`steering/`](steering/) package forces a chosen token at a chosen output position,
with a chosen probability, at a chosen denoising step — and exposes per-step
logits/probabilities. It also plugs into the server as `POST /steer`. See
[STEERING.md](STEERING.md).

## Streamlit workbench

[`streamlit_app.py`](streamlit_app.py) is a frontend over the same `client.steer`
pipeline `example_steer.py` and `run_experiments.py` use — the heavy ~52 GB model
stays on the server, so the workbench only needs the tokenizer + UI deps:

```bash
pip install streamlit pandas
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

It gives you a form for every `SteerConfig` knob (one row per target so you can stage
multiple steers at different denoising steps), shows the baseline and steered text
side-by-side, lists what landed at each pinned position, and visualizes the
denoising-loop convergence from the per-step trace:

- top-1 token trajectory per traced position (one column per step),
- top-1 probability over denoising steps per position (line chart),
- top-k probability stack at a selected position (area chart) — watch competing
  tokens decay as the canvas commits.

Each run can be downloaded as a JSON identical in shape to the trace files
`example_steer --trace-file` writes, so it slots into the existing analysis tools.
